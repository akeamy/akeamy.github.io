        <h2>How I build</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model Selection:</strong> I default to the simplest approach that works — analytics, traditional ML, LLMs, or hybrid systems — avoiding unnecessary complexity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reliability by design:</strong> Deterministic workflows where appropriate, graceful degradation, and clear failure handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Each project includes defined metrics, evaluation pipelines, and stakeholder-aligned success criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance & scale:</strong> Systems are designed to be fast, scalable, and cost-efficient in production.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grounding & trust:</strong> Emphasis on traceability, evaluable outputs, and explainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-world constraints:</strong> Security requirements, compute limits, governance, and user workflows drive design decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business impact:</strong> ROI is assessed early to ensure the solution is worth building and maintaining.
          </li>
