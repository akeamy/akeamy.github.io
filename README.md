Senior AI Engineer & Solutions Architect  
Agentic AI • LLM Systems • RAG • • Knowledge Graphs • Applied ML in National Security

I design and deploy production-grade AI systems with a focus on
agentic workflows, retrieval-augmented generation, and reliability in
high-stakes, regulated environments.

This site serves as a technical portfolio highlighting selected systems,
design patterns, demos, and writing from my work across defense,
cybersecurity, and applied AI as well as the disciplines and interests
that shape how I work.

## What I Work On

My work sits at the intersection of **LLMs, orchestration, and real-world constraints**.

Core focus areas:
- **Agentic AI systems** (LangGraph, CrewAI, ADK-style orchestration)
- **RAG pipelines** with semantic chunking, reranking, and evaluation
- **Hallucination mitigation & traceability**
- **Secure / air-gapped / GovCloud deployments**
- **Applied ML** for cyber, intelligence, and enterprise workflows
- National Security domain Expertise 

I prioritize systems that are **auditable, deterministic where needed,
and deployable beyond demos**.
